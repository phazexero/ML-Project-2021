# ML-Project-2021
A machine learning project which can detect and predict the skin disease through image recognition.
The dataset used for this is the HAM10000 dataset for skin lesions and the project has been done on google colab.

The dataset is imported in and unzipped in the colab for usage, thats why there is a big section where that is shown and and each of the 10000 images and the metadata for the images is uploaded. This is then used in the project.
OpevCV had been used for the image recognition part and the major system is based on a CNN model with SVM classification.
